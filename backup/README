A simple backup script for BSD systems.

Run "backup" out of cron on the machines to be dumped.

Install "rbackup" on the machine that will store the dumps.

Generate an SSH key pair for use by the dump scripts. Install the
private part of the key on the machines running the backup scripts,
and put the public key on the machine hosting the dumps. The public
key should be prefixed with 'command=/path/to/rbackup' to restrict
it to only running the rbackup script. The private key files must
not have a password if you intend to run them from cron.

The backup script will dump all the local UFS filesystems. It
honours the nodump flag at all dump levels. The script maintains a
four week rotation of weekly dump cycles. This gives you a running
four week window of full weekly dumps to fall back on. You can
change this by setting $cycles to the number of weeks to keep around.
Things will get weird if $cycles > 52.

Neither of the scripts need run as the superuser. The "backup"
script requires read access to the raw disk device, easily achieved
by running it under an account in the "operator" group. You will
also have to create the $dumpdates directory, and ensure the account
running the "backup" script has write access there.

Finally, you must edit the backup script to set the $dumphost and $key
variables to match your setup.
