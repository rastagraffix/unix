atags is derived from FreeBSD-10.0's ctags(1).

This is a stripped down ctags, intended for use with the Plan 9
acme editor.  The primary difference is the format of the atags
file, which now features a search field syntax compatible with the
plumber.  Tags file output formats unrelated to that environment
have been removed.

This source release assumes a 44BSD-ish compilation environment.
Specifically, a 4.4BSD bmake environment.  A Pure ANSI C build
with POSIX makefiles will follow at some point.
